    - Unit price comparison with other suppliers
    - Supplier reliability or quality factors
  
  2. **Transport Method Justification:**
    - Why this transport method was selected
    - Shipping cost breakdown
    - Delivery timeframe considerations (delivery days)
    - Reliability score analysis
  
  3. **Cost Analysis:**
    - Total cost calculation (unit price + shipping cost)
    - Comparison with alternative options evaluated
    - Cost savings achieved vs other options
  
  4. **Decision Summary:**
    - Number of alternatives evaluated
    - Key factors that influenced the final decision
    - Trade-offs considered (cost vs speed vs reliability)
  
  **Always present your analysis in a clear, structured format that helps users 
  understand exactly why a particular supplier and transport method combination 
  was recommended.**
